        <p> We provide some basic styling on header tags. In the example, you can see the 6 header tags'different sizes.

        <h3 class="black-text text-lighten-2">Blockqoutes</h3>
        <p>Blockqoutes are mainly used to give emphasis to a quote or citation. You can also use these for some extra text hierarchy and emphasis. </p>
    
        <blockquote>This is an example of quotation that uses the blockqoute tag. Here is another line to make it look bigger

                One common flow we've seen in many frameworks is a lack of support for truly responsive texts. While elements on the page resize fluidly, text still resizes on a fixed basis. To ameliorate this problem, for text heavy pages, we've created a class that fluidly scales text size and line-height to optimize readibility for the user. Line length stays between 45-80 characters and line height scales to larger on smaller screen.

        To see flow text in action, slowly resize your browser and watch the size of thi text body change! Use the button above to toggle off/on flow-text to see the different!
